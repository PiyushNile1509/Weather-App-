# Weather-App
**Project Title:** Weather App using OpenWeatherMap API

**Project Description:**
The Weather App is a web or mobile application that provides real-time weather updates for any location worldwide using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app fetches and displays weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., clear sky, rain, snow). Users can search for a city or allow location access to get automatic weather updates.

**Key Features:**
1. **Real-time Weather Data** – Fetch and display current weather details using OpenWeatherMap API.
2. **Search Functionality** – Allow users to search for weather updates by city name.
3. **Location-based Weather** – Detect the user’s location and provide weather updates automatically.
4. **Detailed Weather Information** – Show temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather description.
5. **Weather Icons & Backgrounds** – Display weather-related icons or background images based on conditions.
6. **Responsive UI** – Ensure a user-friendly interface for both desktop and mobile devices.
7. **Unit Conversion** – Allow users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
8. **5-Day Weather Forecast** – Provide future weather predictions using the API’s forecast data.
9. **Error Handling** – Display meaningful messages if a location is not found or an API error occurs.
10. **Dark Mode Support** – Provide a light/dark mode toggle for better user experience.

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js, Angular, or Vue.js optional)
- Backend: Node.js (if needed for additional processing)
- API: OpenWeatherMap API
- Libraries: Axios or Fetch API for API calls
- Deployment: Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting

**How It Works:**
1. The user opens the app and sees their current location’s weather or enters a city name.
2. The app fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
3. The weather details are displayed with relevant icons and styling.
4. Users can switch temperature units or view a 5-day weather forecast.
5. The app handles errors gracefully, providing appropriate messages.

**Possible Enhancements:**
- Include hourly weather updates.
- Add user authentication for saving favorite locations.
- Implement notifications for severe weather alerts.
- Integrate additional APIs for enhanced weather insights.

This Weather App will serve as a practical project to enhance API integration skills, improve frontend development expertise, and offer a seamless user experience.
